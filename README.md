# truest_of_sights
A small app which tracks your ACTUAL playtime in Dota2  (minus the waiting in lobbies and inactive periods where you left your client open)

Put your steamID (32) on the input field and you'll get some cool informations about your playing and chatting habits!
if you don't know your steam ID use this website https://steamidfinder.com/lookup/ and copy the last 8 digits of steamID3 field (tried to automate this, but sadly Steam doesnt allow frontend api calls)


all data is pulled from OpenDota's Public API
